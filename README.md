# jungle_survival_text_game
 This program is a text game. You wake up alone in the jungle. You don't know how you got there, but try to stay alive.  You have a knife and a rope in your pocket. Build yourself a place to sleep out of wood and rope before dark, or the wild beasts will eat you!
 
Note that the game is in Finnish. Game instructions appear while playing the game.
